# Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [skateshop](<[skateshop.sadmn.com](https://github.com/sadmann7/skateshop)>) :sparkles:.

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

cd skateshop
```

git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### Make changes locally

### Create a pull request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem in the codebase that you believe needs to be fixed, or you have an idea for a new feature, take a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/sadmann7/skateshop/issues).

If you can't find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/sadmann7/skateshop/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/sadmann7/skateshop/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` and `projects` to find issues that need attention.

Then, fork the repository, create a branch, and make your changes.

Finally, open a pull request with the changes.

### Your PR is merged
